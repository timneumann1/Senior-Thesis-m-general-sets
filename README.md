# Senior Thesis: "On m-general sets in AG(k,q) and PG(k,q): Sidon sets, projective arcs and error-correcting codes"

This repository contains my Bachelor's Thesis alongside the code that was used within. In particular, you can find Python and Matlab scripts that explore m-general sets for m = 3,4,5 in affine and projective space in small dimensions over the Galois fields of order 2 and 3. A new LLM approach on 4-general (Sidon) sets in AG(k,3) can be found here:
